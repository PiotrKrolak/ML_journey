# ML_journey

This repository is a collection of my personal projects, notes, and experiments as I explore and learn about machine learning algorithms using Python.
The goal is to document my progress, test different models, and better understand key concepts in machine learning â€” from basic techniques to more advanced topics.
Feel free to browse through the code, and don't hesitate to share feedback or suggestions!
